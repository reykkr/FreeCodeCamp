      <p>There are thousands of programming languages, each with its unique features and purposes.</p>
      <p>The first high-level programming language, Fortran, was developed in the 1950s.</p>
      <p>Python is widely regarded as one of the most popular and versatile programming languages.</p>
      <p>Java is often used for building enterprise-level applications and Android mobile apps.</p>

      <code>const example = 'Hello, World!';</code>
      <code>console.log(example);</code>
      <ul>
        <li>Code Editor: Software used for writing and editing code, such as Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text.</li>
        <li>Compiler/Interpreter: Tools that translate human-readable code into machine-readable instructions.</li>
        <li>Libraries/Frameworks: Pre-built sets of functions and tools to simplify development tasks.</li>
        <li>Version Control: Systems like Git that track changes in code and facilitate collaboration among developers.</li>
        <li>Documentation: Essential for understanding codebases and guiding developers on how to use APIs and functions.</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="main-section" id="HTML">
      <header>HTML</header>
      <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language..</p>
      <p>It is the standard markup language for creating and structuring web pages.</p>
      <p>HTML uses tags to define the structure and content of a web page.</p>
      <p>HTML5 is the latest version of HTML, introducing new elements and features.</p>
      <p>It is essential for building the foundation of websites and web applications.</p>
      <code>&lt;h1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/h1&gt;</code>
      <code>&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</code>
      <ul>
        <li>Tags: HTML uses tags to define elements and structure content, such as p for paragraphs and img for images.</li>
        <li>Attributes: HTML elements can have attributes like "src" for specifying image sources or "href" for links.</li>
        <li>Headings: HTML offers six levels of headings (h1 to h6) to define the hierarchical structure of the content.</li>
        <li>Lists: HTML supports ordered (ol) and unordered (ul) lists for organizing items.</li>
        <li>Links: a tags are used to create hyperlinks that connect web pages and resources.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="CSS">
      <header>CSS</header>
      <p>CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets" and is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and layout of HTML documents.</p>
      <p>CSS allows web developers to apply styles such as colors, fonts, margins, and positioning to HTML elements.</p>
      <p>It follows a cascade hierarchy, where styles can be defined in multiple places, and the most specific rule takes precedence.</p>
      <p>CSS3 is the latest version of CSS and introduced many new features like transitions, animations, and media queries for responsive design.</p>
      <p>CSS can be included in an HTML document using internal styles, inline styles, or by linking an external CSS file.</p>
      <code>body { background-color: #f0f0f0; }</code>
      <code>h1 { color: #333; }</code>
      <ul>
        <li>Selectors: Used to target HTML elements for styling, such as class selectors (e.g., ".classname") or element selectors (e.g., "p").</li>
        <li>Properties: The styling attributes applied to the selected elements, like "color," "font-size," "margin," etc.</li>
        <li>Values: The specific settings assigned to the properties, such as "red" for color or "20px" for margin.</li>
        <li>Box Model: Defines how elements are rendered, consisting of content, padding, border, and margin.</li>
        <li>Media Queries: Used to apply different styles based on the device screen size or other characteristics, enabling responsive design.</li>

      <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
      <h1>JavaScript</h1>
      <p>JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted scripting language primarily used for web development.</p>
      <p>It was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 and originally named "LiveScript" before being renamed to "JavaScript."</p>
      <p>JavaScript is often used to add interactivity and dynamic content to websites, enabling client-side functionality.</p>
      <p>Node.js allows JavaScript to be used on the server-side, facilitating full-stack development.</p>
      <p>Despite its name, JavaScript is unrelated to Java and has different syntax and use cases.</p>
  <code>console.log("Hello, World!");</code>
  <ul>
        <li>Scripting language</li>
        <li>Used for web development</li>
        <li>Client-side interactivity</li>
        <li>Node.js for server-side</li>
        <li>Different from Java</li>
      </ul>
          
      <h1>Java</h1>
      <p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s.</p>
      <p>It was designed to be platform-independent, allowing "write once, run anywhere" (WORA) capabilities through the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</p>
      <p>Java is widely used for enterprise-level applications, Android app development, and various other software projects.</p>
      <p>Java's syntax is similar to C++, making it familiar to developers with a background in C-based languages.</p>
      <p>Java applications are compiled into bytecode, which is executed by the JVM at runtime.</p>
      <code>System.out.println("Hello, World!");</code>
      <ul>
        <li>Object-oriented language</li>
        <li>Platform-independent</li>
        <li>JVM enables WORA</li>
        <li>Popular for enterprise and Android</li>
        <li>Compiled into bytecode</li>

        <li>It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.</p>
      <p>Python emphasizes code readability and simplicity.</p>
      <p>It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.</p>
      <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language</p>
      <p>Python has a large standard library and a thriving community with extensive third-party packages.</p>

      <code>print(greeting)</code>
      <ul>
        <li>Simplicity: Python emphasizes readability and straightforward syntax, making it easy to learn and understand.</li>
        <li>Dynamically Typed: Python is dynamically typed, meaning variable types are determined at runtime, allowing for flexible and concise code.</li>
        <li>Interpreted: Python code is executed line-by-line by an interpreter, enabling rapid development and easier debugging.</li>
        <li>High-Level Data Structures: Python provides built-in support for lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets, making complex data manipulation simpler.</li>
        <li>Extensive Standard Library: Python comes with a vast collection of modules and libraries, providing a wide range of functionalities for various tasks.</li>
